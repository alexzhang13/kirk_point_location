# Randomized simple polygon generation
Implementation and experiments for random simple polygon generation.

There are two different generations, one being based on circles and the other being based on a set of random
points from the convex hull.

## Dependencies
The only dependencies are `matplotlib`, `argparse`, and `numpy`, but there is a `requirements.txt` file that can be used as well.
